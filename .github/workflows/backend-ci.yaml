# Build a Continuous Integration pipeline for the backend application
# using Github Actions.
# The pipeline should be configured to meet the team's needs,
# fulfilling the requirements of linting, testing,
# and building of the application on every pull request against the main branch.

# A Continuous Integration workflow that:
#   Runs on pull_requests against the main branch,
#   only when code in the frontend application changes.
#   Is able to be run on-demand (i.e., manually without needing to push code)
#   Runs the following jobs in parallel:
#   Runs a linting job that fails if the code doesn't adhere to eslint rules
#   Runs a test job that fails if the test suite doesn't pass
#   Runs a build job only if the lint and test jobs pass
#   and successfully builds the application
